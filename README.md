# darktimes calendar
- block out when the sun's not out as a daily Google calendar event
- each event starts at sunset, and ends at sunrise
- uses https://sunrisesunset.io/api/ (thanks!)

### make your own darktimes
1. Copy and paste the script into [AppScript](https://script.google.com/)
2. Use your own calendar ID; adjust timezone and/or event name. I like creating a new calendar just for darktime events so that I can toggle it on and off and adjust settings for it independently. 
3. Set up a trigger so that it runs automatically. This script is written to run monthly, so the trigger should be once a month.

### known issues
- right now, no adjustment for daylight savings, so you need to manually tweak the appscript twice a year.

## PST version
If you are in Pacific Standard Time, and want the calendar as is, feel free to subscribe to [my existing calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NGUyNDhhZjEyZTkxMWFiMjA5ZjNkOWQ0YmMwNDliZjMwNThiMDZhOTQyYzNiNjBkOTYzYTM2MjQ1ODFhMDQ1N0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t). 
It will bulk add new events at the beginning of each month.
